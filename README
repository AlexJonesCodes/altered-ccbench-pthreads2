try:
make UNAME=i3_7020U
or I9_13900HX
or RYZEN53600

For 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900HX systems, the profiler now auto-detects the
processor model at runtime and applies the platform default pfd correction even if
the build was not compiled with `UNAME=i9_13900HX`.

typical run command is 
./ccbench -r 10000 -t "[12,12,12]" -x "[1,2,3]" -b 0
this means 10000 repititions, run 3 tests of cas(12) every iteration, put the cache line in thread 0's cache and have cores 1 2 3 compete to get the cache line first.

libnuma will need to be installed when running make, run 
sudo -i
apt-get update
apt-get install 
apt-get install libnuma-dev

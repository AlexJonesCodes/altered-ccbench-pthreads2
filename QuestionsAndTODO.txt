Question: how much extra latency comes purely from moving a cache line’s ownership across the interconnect?
Question: does op A harm op B more than B harms A?
Question: when contention increases, does the system slow down evenly or does it start starving some threads?
Question: do coherence events create long stalls that only show up in the tail?
Question: how much interference comes from sharing the same cache line vs “nearby” but distinct lines?
Question: how much do readers suffer when a writer is bouncing ownership?
Question: are there stable “winners” (same core dominates every time), or does dominance rotate?
Question: does an SMT sibling thread make coherence effects worse or better? (multithreaded q though)
Question: does who “owns” the line first shape the outcome?
Question: does a hot contended atomic line slow down unrelated atomics elsewhere?


Will: Do different instruction types effect the overall fairness of the system? 
Will: When threads of the same core compete, what does fairness look like: assumption, equal winners.
Will: Cache line placement, move the -b param from 0 to n threads, see how that effects latency
